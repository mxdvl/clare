Spring sky opens up

Revealing themselves

For the very first time

No longer dressing in disguise

They exhibit all

In hope of being adored

After raining down upon those

Who stood loyally beneath them

For months

And months

On end.

\- Clare Welch

> The sky never fails to amaze me. Forever changing and revealing different sides to itself.
