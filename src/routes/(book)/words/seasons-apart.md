Grey clouds hang like puppets in the sky

No space for blue skies to occupy

Summer’s not welcome for very long

Winter comes and banishes birdsong

The cold, wet pavements don’t want to hear

Outdoor venues spraying out Shakespeare

People yearn for that warmer weather

No need to wrap up, clad in leather

Seasons sit like neighbours side by side

Putting up fences out of sheer pride.

\- Clare Welch
