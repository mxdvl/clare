Calorific words weigh us down.

We're way too saturated

By your suited and booted jargon.

The public wants answers,

Words solidified by your creations.

Stop shifting the blame,

Go exceed our expectations.

For the youth don't know where to look

For lack of inspiration

So they walk around in circles

In hope and anticipation

That someday you will stop and look.

For they are the future,

All-seeing, current, educated eyes,

Who lament for a time they will never know.

\- Clare Welch
