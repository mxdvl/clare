Calorific words weigh us down

We're way too saturated

By your suited and booted jargon

The public wants answers

Words solidified by your creations

Stop shifting the blame

Go exceed our expectations

For the youth don't know where to look

For lack of inspiration

So they walk around in circles

In hope and anticipation

That someday you will stop and look

For they are the future

All-seeing, current, educated eyes

Who lament for a time they will never know.

\- Clare Welch
