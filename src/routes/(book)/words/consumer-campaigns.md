Box up the problem, hoping it will all go away,

Do you listen to the youth and let them have their say?

Writing messages in fast food chains

Producing throw away campaigns.

While,

Street crime rages on in crimson

Seeping through the same paved stones your politics were built upon.

You don’t hear the real sounds,

Although it throbs and pounds.

Yet, the birds spit a sad spring song.

For they see all,

Standing tall,

Above the bloodshed,

And like lambs, young men lay dead.

And you, **yes you**, attribute it all to ‘street cred’.
