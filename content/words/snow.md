**Snow**

Like you and I, it differs from day-to-day

Sometimes, it cracks like crème brulée

To reveal a soft centre it stows away.

Sometimes, like confetti it purposely scatters itself

Similar to flowers carefully arranged on a shelf.

Like you and I, it differs from day-to-day

Sometimes it rolls and sticks,

Other times, it’s impossible to fix.

It sifts through like hot sand

It melts in the palm of a warm hand

It ices over in the cold of the night

It blinds temporarily seizing your sight.

Like you and I, it never stays still

Difficult to define

Full of determination and will.

Like you and I, it twinkles under the moon

Like you and I, it dazzles under the sun

Like you and I, it shines.

> Written in Canada. Snow, like many things, is so hard to define. Sometimes, it's best to appreciate nature, things and people for what and who they are on a day-to-day basis. Definitions can be so restrictive.
