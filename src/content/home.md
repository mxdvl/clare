**Senior User Researcher Consultant working at [Opencast](https://opencastsoftware.com/).**

5 years experience working as a user researcher in the public and private sector.

Having previously worked extensively in education and abroad, my experience spans a breadth of cultures and age groups. I bring a wide skill set to the user researcher role. People have always been at the centre of my work. A strong advocate of user centred design and passionate about creating services that include and enable users.

In my free time, I love socialising, writing, watching a good series or documentary, reading a book I can get lost in, completing a crossword (or at least giving it a go), planning my next adventure, dancing to Lady Gaga, trying new foods and eating pizza.

Way too much pizza. üçï
