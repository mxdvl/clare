Crammed right in

Smoked-filled eyes

Grills churn out

Meat-on-sticks.

_Biru, niku_ — _“Sumimasen!“_

Suits and boots

Coat-dressed walls

Drinks are chugged

Tables touch.

_Biru, niku_ — _“Kampai!”_

Smoke filled air

Loosened ties

Night goes on…

Another late one in the office.

> **An izakaya is more than just a place to eat and drink. It has heart. It's a place where everything is alive. From the meat turning on sticks, to the waiters speedily shuffling from table to table, to the calls of "sumimasen".**
>
> **It's where graduates drink too much during a nomihodai.**
>
> **It's an office.**
>
> **It's where transactions are made.**
>
> **It's where working relationships are cemented.**
>
> **Like no other place: it's an izakaya.**
