Hi, Iâ€™m Clare without an **i**.

Keen writer and educator.

In my free time, I love socialising with friends, meeting new people, writing, watching a good series or documentary, reading a book I can get lost in, completing a crossword (or at least giving it a go), planning my next adventure, dancing to Lady Gaga, trying new foods and eating pizza.

Way too much pizza.
