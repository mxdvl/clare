**#notALLmen**

Not all men, they gripe

Not all men, they snipe

From the comfort of their computer-lit rooms.

“Leave me alone,” they insist

“Get off me,” they persist

From within their rigid four walls and bathrooms.

Not all men, they moan

Not all men, they groan

Cowardly clicking away on keyboards.

“We want to be safe,” they cry

“We want to be free,” they sigh

Bravely standing up in the House of Lords.

“Not all men, you say?”

Not all men, “OK…”

“If not all men, then what is it then?”

As

“Not all women!”

They chant

“Not all women!”

They chant

Again and again and again

Want to adhere

To men

Want to live in fear

Of men

Again and again,

Not again.

> [Most women](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/mar/10/almost-all-young-women-in-the-uk-have-been-sexually-harassed-survey-finds) in the UK are subjected to sexual harassment. Most woman in the UK feel that they have to police their own safety and that of their peers. Most women have lost trust. Most women want change and not all men are happy with that. Step up, men. Women have done their part.
