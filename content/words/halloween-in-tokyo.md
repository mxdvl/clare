Halloween in Tokyo is a true feast for the eyes.

Shibuya becomes a cauldron of colour as Mignons, ghouls and nurses glide across the ‚ÄòScramble‚Äô in their thousands. The streets of Tokyo are transformed into catwalks where people strut and show off their carefully crafted guises.

Hours of work spent on perfecting life-like wounds and coming up with original ideas are proudly displayed like carefully-positioned mannequins in shop windows.

People hope that they will be papped as Halloween in Tokyo grants individuals their 15 minutes of fame.

Police dread the event. They stand in vain [attempting to control the direction of the crowd](https://mainichi.jp/english/graphs/20181101/hpe/00m/0na/001000g/7) that becomes more and more untameable.

And, in all fairness, the event has ballooned at an astronomical rate.

Over the last decade, Halloween has grown to become one of the most popular annual events in Japan.

It is no coincidence that this rise in popularity has sat alongside the social media boom; not only is the event highly instagrammable, but it also gives lovers of „Ç≥„Çπ„Éó„É¨ (Cosplay) a stage for the night.

My first ever experience of Halloween in Tokyo was in 2015.

Very much inspired by my higher being that is Lady Gaga, I decided to try and recreate her skeleton garb from the [_Born This Way_ video](https://youtu.be/wV1FrqwZyKw). Note to self, face paint is extremely high maintenance and soon becomes an indistinguishable smudge and unbreathable layer of skin. The pink wig, not the perfect shade I was looking for, in all its fluorescent glory, made its mark amongst the flashing billboards of the city. Mind you, it was about as easy to tame as the Barbie‚Äôs hair I mullered in the nineties. Isn‚Äôt Barbie‚Äôs hair the weirdest material known to humankind?

Yet, my get-up seemed to be a crowd-pleaser. I joined in with the masquerade, posed with others and admired the plethora of costumes.

Never being a big fan of horror films, I favoured the candy-washed interpretation of scary. In the midst of my joy at Halloween in Tokyo, I was slowly approached by a person convincingly dressed as [Sadako from _The Ring_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sadako_Yamamura). Horror movies are not for me. Never have been. Never will be. If I watch anything remotely scary, I say goodbye to a week‚Äôs worth of sleep. So, Sadoko approaching me was not high up on my Tokyo list of things to do. Long, black hair approached me. I uttered (squealed), ‚ÄòOh my God‚Äô several times. Unwittingly knowing that in fact, 'Sadako' was Haruka Minowa (ÁÆïËº™ „ÅØ„Çã„Åã), a famous comedian and member of the Japanese comedy duo [Harisenbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harisenbon). I later learned that this encounter had been filmed. So there it is, the story of how I ended up on Japanese TV and ticking off one of my ultimate bucket list items; to be laughed at by a floating presenter (you‚Äôll know if you‚Äôve ever watched NHK).

Although I had never been a big enthusiast of Halloween, I could see why this event was so popular. It brought everyone together. It was colourful. It was a chance for adults to dress up and not take themselves so seriously for the night. It was a glorious street party for anyone who wanted to have fun. 

No trickery, just a real treat.

Halloween in Tokyo is a must.

Who knows, you may even end up on TV, too. üéÉ
