Like a wheel

You make me spin

To decide upon a best-fit-descriptor

What if my shade does not fit?

Just to fit a social criteria?

Yet society dictates

And the haters permeate

The shell I choose not to name.

And so I keep spinning

Spiralling away

For I will never be a box

Neither a tick

Nor a quota.

\- Clare Welch
