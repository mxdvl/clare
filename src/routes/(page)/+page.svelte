<h1>Nice to meet you. üëã</h1>

<p class="bold">
  Senior User Researcher Consultant working at <a
    href="https://opencastsoftware.com/">Opencast</a
  >.
</p>

<p>
  Having worked extensively in education and abroad, my experience spans a
  breadth of cultures and age groups. I bring a wide skill set to the user
  researcher role. People have always been at the centre of my work. From
  understanding the way people learn, to working with diverse groups in the UK
  and abroad, I am a strong advocate of user centred design.
</p>

<p>Passionate about creating spaces where people feel they belong.</p>

  In my free time, I love socialising, writing, watching a good series or
  documentary, reading a book I can get lost in, completing a crossword (or at
  least giving it a go), planning my next adventure, dancing to Lady Gaga,
  trying new foods and eating pizza.
</p>

<p>Way too much pizza. üçï</p>
