You get up and heckle us, look like such a clown.

Do you think you win at publicly slamming us down?

You're weaker, smaller and far less intelligent,

Up your game, because you're not so eloquent.

Whilst across the Atlantic Ocean,

Another moans, tweets and gripes.

But Malala, she travels, inspires and writes.

Stop flashing us in magazines and selfies looking all pristine.

Right now, we need it more than ever, #IWD2017.

In response to International Women's Day and the backdrop of political figures shamelessly berating women in the public domain.
