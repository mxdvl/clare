Hi there, I’m **Clare** without an **i**.

## Page CMS editing

The homepage content now lives in [`src/content/home.md`](src/content/home.md). It is editable through [Pages CMS](https://pagescms.org/) using the configuration in [`pagescms.config.json`](pagescms.config.json). The configuration exposes a single Markdown page so the CMS focuses entirely on the main landing page copy.

To edit locally:

1. Commit your changes and push the repository so Pages CMS can read the configuration.
2. Visit [https://cms.pages.dev/](https://cms.pages.dev/) and connect the repository.
3. Select the “Homepage” entry to edit the Markdown content and publish the update back to Git.
